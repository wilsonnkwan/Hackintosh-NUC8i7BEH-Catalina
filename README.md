# Hackintosh-NUC8i7BEH-Catalina
Hackintosh - Catalina for NUC8i7BEH

The work of this EFI is credited to LeeSureOne from TonyMacx86, please give him credit. 

Please do not submit issues here, it will be ignored because I am not trained to troubleshoot. 

This repo serves two purposes, primarily a record for myself and secondarily, a testimony to tell you that this EFI works. Refer to https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-intel-nuc7-nuc8-using-clover-uefi-nuc7i7bxx-nuc8i7bxx-etc.261711/post-1968320. You should refer to this thread for the latest updates.

The EFI will work for Catalina, however, do note that Catalina do not have drivers for USB Wifi or USB LAN, so my suggestion to you is to get a USB Wifi that is in the Chris1111's https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Adapter-Clover
